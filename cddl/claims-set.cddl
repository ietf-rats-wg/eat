; This is the fundamental definition of a Claims-Set for both CBOR
; and JSON. It is a set of label-value pairs each of which is a
; claim.
;
; In CBOR the labels can be integers or strings with a strong
; preference for integers.  For JSON, the labels are always strings.
;
; The values can be anything, with some consideration for types that
; can work in both CBOR and JSON.
