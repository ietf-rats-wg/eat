/ This is an attestation of a public key and the key store     /
/ implementation that protects and manages it. The key store   /
/ implementation is in a security-oriented execution           /
/ environment separate from the high-level OS (HLOS), for      /
/ example a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The key store /
/ is the Attester.                                             /

/ There is some attestation of the high-level OS, just version /
/ and boot & debug status. It is a Claims-Set submodule because/
/ it has lower security level than the key store. The key      /
/ store's implementation has access to info about the HLOS, so /
/ it is able to include it.                                    /
/                                                              /
/ A key and an indication of the user authentication given to  /
/ allow access to the key is given. The labels for these are   /
/ in the private space since this is just a hypothetical       /
/ example, not part of a standard protocol.                    /
/                                                              /
/ This is similar to Android Key Attestation.                  /
