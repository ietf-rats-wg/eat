; CoSWID section 8 don't provide the CDDL that is needed
; for EAT, in particular the CDDL for a non-tag CoSWID,
; so it is provided here.
;
; CoSWID section 8 does not allow for a signed CoSWID 
; without a COSE tag number. This is different from 
; CWT which does allow it. CoSWID section 8 doesn't
; say this in prose, but the CDDL does specify it.

untagged-coswid = concise-swid-tag / untagged-signed-coswid1

; The COSE payload of COSE here is as specified in CoSWID, 
; a concise-swid-tag. 
;
; CoSWID section 8 replicates and modifies a lot of the COSE
; CDDL for several reasons. One is so that the type of the
; COSE payload can be explicitly specified in CDDL. That is
; not done with this CDDL for brevity. This does reduce the
; amount of CDDL validation possible, but is not an
; underspecification.
