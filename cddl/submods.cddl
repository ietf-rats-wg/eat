; A submodule can be:
; - A simple Claims-Set (always encoded same as the enclosing token)
; - A nested token which is a fully formed EAT token or any type.
;   It may be CBOR or JSON encoded, or signed or unsigned.
;   See the definition of Nested-Token in cbor-nested-tokend.cddl
;   or in json-nested-token.cddl.
; - The digest of a detached Claims-Set (encoded the same as
;   the enclosing token)
;
