; This specifies how one fully-formed token is nested inside a
; CBOR-format token.  The fully-formed nested token is any valid
; token, CBOR or JSON (JWT, CWT, UCCS, DEB...)  The mechanism for
; identifying the type of the nested token is specific to the format
; of the surrounding token, CBOR in this case.
;
; A primary reason this is encoding-specific is that JSON does not
; have an equivalent to CBOR tags.
;
; If the data type here is text, then the nested token is JSON
; format, one of a JWT, UJCS or JSON-encoded DEB. The means for
; distinguishing which is in the definition of JSON-encoded
; Nested-Token.  If the data type is bstr, then the nested token
; is CBOR format. It is byte-string wrapped and identified by a
;CBOR tag.
