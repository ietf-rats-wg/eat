    / First part is a full EAT token with claims like nonce and /
    / UEID. Most importantly, it includes a submodule that is a /
    / detached digest which is the hash of the "TEE" claims set /
    / in the next section.                                      /

    / TODO: replace this one that is actually signed using      /
    / COSE. (There is nothing wrong with not being signed, but  /
    / it is a better example signed rather than UCCS            /
